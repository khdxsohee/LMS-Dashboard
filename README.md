-   **Font Awesome Icons:** Utilizes a vast library of icons for a professional look without relying on image assets.

## Technologies Used

-   **HTML5:** For the basic structure and content of the dashboard.
-   **CSS3:** For styling, layout (Flexbox, Grid), and responsiveness.
-   **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):** For basic interactivity (e.g., tab switching).
-   **Font Awesome 6:** For scalable vector icons.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

You only need a web browser to view this project. No special server environment is required for the front-end part.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository (or download the files):**

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/khdxsohee/LMS-Dashboard.git
    ```
  

2.  **Open `dashboard.html`:**
    Simply open the `dashboard.html` file in your preferred web browser.

    ```
    
  ### For macOS/Linux (might vary)
    open dashboard.html

  ### For Windows
    start dashboard.html
    ```
    Alternatively, you can just double-click the `index.html` file in your file explorer.

## Project Structure

lms-dashboard-ui/
- ├── dashboard.html          # Main HTML file for the dashboard
- ├── style.css           # All CSS styles for the layout and components
- └── script.js           # Basic JavaScript for interactivity (e.g., tab switching)
- └── README.md           # This file


## Usage

This project is a front-end template. You can use it as a starting point for building a full-fledged LMS.

-   **Navigate:** Click on sidebar items to see the active state change.
-   **Filter:** Click on the subject tabs or class filters to see the active state change (actual content filtering would require JavaScript and potentially a backend).
-   **Explore:** Scroll through the various sections to see the dashboard layout.

## Future Enhancements (Backend Integration)

This project currently only includes the front-end (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). To make it a fully functional LMS, you would need to integrate a backend. Here's how you might proceed:

-   **Backend Language/Framework:** Choose a language like PHP (with Laravel/CodeIgniter), Node.js (with Express), Python (with Django/Flask), etc.
-   **Database:** Utilize a database system like MySQL (as discussed), PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.
-   **Key Backend Functionalities:**
    -   **User Authentication & Authorization:** Secure login, registration, role management (student, instructor, admin).
    -   **Course Management:** CRUD operations for courses, lessons, quizzes, assignments.
    -   **Enrollment System:** Allow students to enroll in courses and track their progress.
    -   **Data Fetching:** APIs to fetch dynamic data for courses, classes, user profiles, and activity charts from the database.
    -   **Notifications:** Implement real-time or scheduled notifications.
    -   **Payment Gateway:** If offering paid courses.
-   **JavaScript for Dynamic Content:** Use `fetch` API or `XMLHttpRequest` in `script.js` to get data from your backend APIs and dynamically populate the dashboard sections (e.g., `Recommended Courses`, `Your Classes`).
-   **Charting Library:** Integrate a JavaScript charting library like [Chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/) or [D3.js](https://d3js.org/) to render the "Learning Activities" graph with real data from your backend.
